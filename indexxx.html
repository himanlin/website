            <h2>About</h2>
            <p align="justify">I am interested in social networks and computational social science. I received my B.A. in Economics at National Taiwan University in June 2023. Besides, I was an exchange student at Lund University, Sweden, in 2022–2023.</p>
            <p align="justify">Currently, I work as a research assistant in the Institute of Sociology at Academia Sinica, Taiwan, supervised by Dr. Hsuan-Wei Lee, and am applying for a graduate program.</p>
            <p>Here is my CV in pdf format.<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WOhbvsDoypaSnGHDazGbmjsjFp513bR5/view?usp=sharing">[link]</a>

                (under reviewed by Social Science and Medicine)<br>
                This study focused on the unique communication patterns of health professionals on social media platforms, which are mostly based in the United States, particularly in the context of the pandemic outbreak in the first half of 2020. In this research, I employed empirical quantitative research methodologies, encompassing time series analysis, natural language processing, and social network analysis, to analyze the public conversation that was embedded in the subsequent relationship, changing across the time period. We fill the gap in the literature that mainly discusses how national and international health agencies take actions during pandemics. We use a mixed-methods approach to provide a more systematic understanding of the information shared by health professionals that aligns with their personal political attitudes.<br>

                This study delved into the dynamics of peer pressure and homophily in the context of cooperation, specifically within spatial public good game scenarios. It highlights that a small or medium level of peer pressure and high levels of homophily can enhance cooperative behaviors, potentially addressing social dilemmas like vaccine hesitancy, which poses a risk to society due to the decline in prosocial behavior. To bridge the gap in past collective action literature in sociology, focused on pairwise interaction illustrated by the prisoner's dilemma, the research demonstrates that meso-level forces have an impact on the group interactions of individuals, leading to collective social results.  And I presented this paper at the 2023 annual meeting of the American Sociological Association and the Taiwanese Sociological Association.

               How do athletic labor markets become globalized? Agentbased simulations of club recruitment behavior in the worldwide market for football talent

                We collaborated using computational modeling to determine which theory best explains how the labor market globalized, a topic labor sociologists frequently debate. I conducted the simulation of the project. And I presented this paper at the 2021 annual meeting of the Taiwanese Sociological Association and the 2021 World Congress of Sociology of Sport Program. We analyzed and compared the three theoretical ideas in the sport sociological literature about how European clubs drive the globalization of the labor market in the core leagues of world football. In contrast to clubs promulgating globalization through exploiting economic differentials, historical linkages, or cultural-linguistic similarities between countries, the results of this study suggest that clubs might be a more limited force behind globalization as they are constrained by the high costs of global recruitment.     Such an analysis matters for understanding the globalization of athletic labor markets because it provides a more precise understanding of which of the three theoretical ideas provides the most plausible explanation for how the labor market in contemporary professional football has globalized.

                Motivated by a strong desire to contribute to the community’s welfare, we initiated this research. I analyzed the data. And I wrote the manuscript together with Dr. Lee. Our research investigates the relationships among individual networks and social trust, particularly examining the connections between generalized trust and institutional trust within Taiwanese society. The study analyzes how factors such as the strength of personal networks, social capital, family relationships, and life courses may influence an individual's level of social trust. Our objective is to provide insights into improving social trust by examining the dynamics in Taiwan's context, shaped by East Asian and Chinese cultural differences that set it apart from Western countries. This endeavor contributes to the academic community that has shaped my growth.
